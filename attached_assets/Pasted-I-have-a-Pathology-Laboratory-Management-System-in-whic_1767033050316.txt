I have a Pathology Laboratory Management System in which I already have around 43 tests created, but I now want to upgrade it to a fully professional and complete pathology software system with a minimum of 74+ different medical diagnostic tests. Currently, many tests only show a single parameter in the report creation page, while in real-world pathology reporting each test contains multiple parameters, exact units, medically correct normal reference ranges, automatic high/low/normal detection, and a professional reporting format. I want you to completely fix and rebuild the entire “Test Management and Report Generation System” without changing my existing dashboard layout, theme, UI design, or structure. The UI must remain exactly as it is right now, only the functionality, data, and test structures must be upgraded professionally.

Every single test must have a proper structured table with columns Parameter Name, Value Input, Unit, Normal Range, and Status, where Status should automatically update as Normal, High, or Low based on the entered values and defined medical reference ranges. This logic must support numeric values, gender-based normal ranges, age-based ranges, text-based interpretation values, and must work exactly like real hospital and diagnostic center pathology software. Every test page must have Patient Details, Test Name, Test Code, Full Parameter Table, Technician Name, Referred Doctor, Remarks Section, Auto Status Calculation, and professional printable medical report output. Reports must look like real hospital lab reports and should be nicely aligned and readable for doctors and patients.

You must also implement a powerful Test Management System where each test has testId, testName, category, description, detailed parameters list, units, ranges, interpretation note, activation status, and admin editing capability. Admin should be able to view, edit, activate, and deactivate any test, and newly added tests must automatically appear in both Admin Dashboard and User Dashboard. Users must be able to select any test or health package, enter results, automatically see status, and generate a final professional report.

I want complete pathology coverage including Hematology (CBC complete multi-parameter report like Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, Platelets, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils), ESR, CRP, hs-CRP, Peripheral Smear, Reticulocyte Count, PT, INR, Bleeding Time, Clotting Time, Blood Group & Rh Factor. Endocrine and Thyroid profile such as T3, T4, TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Anti-TPO must work. Lipid profile must include Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, Triglycerides, and lipid ratio with automatic interpretation. Liver Function Test must include Bilirubin Total, Direct, Indirect, SGOT, SGPT, ALP, Total Protein, Albumin, Globulin. Kidney Function tests must include Urea, Creatinine, Uric Acid, Electrolytes including Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Calcium, Phosphorus. Diabetes profile must support FBS, PPBS, RBS, HbA1C, Urine Sugar, Ketones. Cardiac marker tests like Troponin I, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, D-Dimer must be implemented exactly like real world standards. Infection tests must support HIV 1 & 2, HBsAg, HCV, Widal, Dengue NS1, Dengue IgG/IgM, Malaria, Typhoid. Urine Routine and Microscopy must include Physical, Chemical, and Microscopy parameters. Vitamin Tests including Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D must also work. Add additional tests to make minimum 74 total tests. Every test must have accurate units, properly formatted tables, valid reference ranges, clean UI consistency, and each test must have status logic.

Along with individual tests, multiple Health Checkup Packages must also work properly such as Full Body Checkup, Master Health Checkup, Basic Health Package, Diabetic Package, Thyroid Package, Liver Package, Kidney Package, Female Health Package, where selecting a package automatically loads all included tests, allows result entry, calculates status, and generates a combined single report professionally. Admin must also be able to manage packages. Everything must remain responsive, clean and integrated smoothly. Do not change my UI theme or design structure. Just make the Test System, Report Module, Package System, Auto Status System fully powerful, real-world ready, medically accurate, professional and production level. After your upgrade, my system should feel like a real hospital pathology reporting software where all 74+ tests have complete structure, full professional report format, correct medical ranges, automatic status update, package support, admin control panel management, and final reports must be production ready and printable.
