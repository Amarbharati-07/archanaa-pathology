Fix my existing Pathology Portal so that the Confirm Booking button works properly and implement a full booking + payment + admin verification system with PostgreSQL (NO MongoDB).

When user clicks “Confirm Booking”:
• Payment screen must open
• Show multiple payment options: UPI QR Scan, UPI ID, UPI Apps, Debit/Credit Card
• After user completes payment, store payment status as “Pending Verification” in database
• Booking must be created for that patient with patient id, test name, price, address, booking mode, date and time

Booking System Requirements:
• Two booking modes: Home Sample Collection OR Lab Visit
• If Home Collection selected → check distance logic:
  - If user location within 5 KM → allowed without extra charges
  - If user distance up to 40 KM → allowed with extra charges (show updated price)
  - If beyond 40 KM → show “Home collection unavailable” and suggest Lab Visit
• Store location and mode
• Admin can see this information

Admin Panel Requirements:
• Admin must see every new booking in booking section with:
  patient id, patient name, test name, amount, booking date, address, mode, distance, payment status
• Admin must verify payment manually
• Admin marks payment status as “Verified” or “Rejected”
• Only after payment verification admin can generate test report
• Admin uploads report file + remarks + result + date
• Report must appear in both Admin dashboard and User dashboard
• If payment NOT verified → user should NOT be able to download report
• Show status badges: Payment Pending, Payment Verified, Report Pending, Report Generated

User Dashboard:
• After login user should see:
  profile, booking details, booking history, payment history, report status
• For every booking show:
  booking id, test name, price, booking mode, address, booking date, payment status, report status
• If payment not verified → show “Waiting for Admin Approval”
• If report generated → show download button, otherwise show status badge

Important:
• Do NOT rebuild project
• Remove any dummy logic
• Fetch all data from PostgreSQL
• Confirm Booking button must fully work end-to-end
• Clean and professional UI
