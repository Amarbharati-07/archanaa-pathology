## Packages
embla-carousel-react | For the reviews and featured packages carousel
framer-motion | For smooth animations and transitions
lucide-react | For comprehensive icon set (already in base but vital)

## Notes
The backend provides endpoints for tests, packages, and reviews.
We need to implement a Cart Context for managing selected tests/packages locally.
Mock authentication will be handled via an Auth Context (local state).
Images will use high-quality Unsplash medical placeholders.
